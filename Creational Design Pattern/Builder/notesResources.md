Build Design Patter is mostly used to create a product one 
step at a time.

Can this be used to create data pipeline ? Where 
transformations will be applied one at a time ?

We can create some example where a Pandas DF can be read, 
Transformed(Direct Mapping, Default Mapping, TypeCast, 
CustomTransformation), Where each gets applied in certain 
order and add to the previous DF.
